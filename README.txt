If you want to make image galleries, or display user uploaded photos that are different size and aspect ratio, this scripts automatically gets best width/height values, depending of stage (image placeholder) dimensions.

GD library needs to be enabled on server for PHP, since the script is calling "getimagesize" function to get width and height of uploaded image.
